start building idea
need to host application on a system that is never turned off -> a data center or a virtual machine 
	evelopment environment, production environment
	purchase a domain name and map that to server
building the code: Converting code from a text format to a binary or executable format
need a solution that can help collaborate. Git helps all developers to work on the same application at the same time and collaborate efficiently.
Git is the underlying technology, and GitHub is the publicly hosted Git-based central repository of code
	Some other similar platforms are GitLab and Bitbucket

workflow
	developers pushing code to a central GitHub repository
	the CI/CD pipeline pulls the code to the build server
		CI/CD tools release features faster and more frequently with less manual effort
	builds it to Docker images
	image is used to test the application in the test environment
		Containers package the application and its dependencies into an image that can then be run on any system without worrying about dependencies
	deployed in a production environment as containers by Container orchestration platform
		Container orchestration platform auto scale containers as well as the underlying infrastructure based on need and manage resources on the underlying service to ensure optimal resource utilization
