have 2 systems (laptops, desktops, VMs on the Cloud, wherever) (192.168.1.10 (host A) and 192.168.1.11 (host B))
use an interface on the host to connect them to a switch -> the switch creates a network containing the two systems
	ip link  # show name of the interface that we will be using to connect to the switch
	cat >> /etc/hosts  # when I say db, I mean the IP 192.168.1.11
		192.168.1.11	db
	when referencing another host by its name from host A, it looks into /etc/hosts file in local to find out the IP address
	but for complex environment, move all these entries into a single server who will manage it centrally. It is called DNS server
		cat /etc/resolv.conf
			nameserver	192.168.1.100
			search          mycompany.com  # web -> web.company.com
		this name with your www. and .com at the end is called a domain name
			the reason they are in this format, separated by dots, is to group like things together
			www. is a subdomain, if there is anything between www. and .domain, it is a subdomain
			the dot is the root
			the top level domains
				com for commercial or general purpose
				net for educational organizations
				org for nonprofit organizations
	tool to test DNS resolution
		ping
		nslookup
		dig
have a network with the address (192.168.1.0)
assign the systems with IP addresses on the same network
	ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev enp1s0
The switch can only enable communication within 1 network

have 2 other systems (laptops, desktops, VMs on the Cloud, wherever) (192.168.2.10 and 192.168.2.11)
A router helps connect 2 networks together, it can be thought as another server with many network ports (assign the first network to IP address/gateway 192.168.1.1; assign the second to gateway at 192.168.2.1)
	route
	ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1  # can reach the 192.168.2.0 network through the door or gateway at 192.168.1.1
	ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1  # can reach the 192.168.1.0 network through the door or gateway at 192.168.2.1
	ip route add default via 192.168.2.1  # for any network that you don't know a route 2, use this router as the default gateway
		could also say 0.0.0.0 instead of the word `default`. It means any IP destination
how we can set up a Linux host as a router
	three host, A, B, C
	A and B are connected to a network (192.168.1.0) both using interface eth0
	B and C to another (192.168.2.0) both using interface eth1 in B and eth0 in C
	A has IP 192.168.1.5
	C has 192.168.2.5
	B has an IP on both the networks, 192.168.1.6 and 192.168.2.6
		ping 192.168.2.5  # Host A need to reach host C at 192.168.2.0 network
			ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.6  # add a route to access network 192.168.2 through the gateway 192.168.1.6
			ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.6  # host C will have to send back responses to host A
	By default, in Linux, packets are not forwarded from one interface to the next.
		For example, packets received on eth0 on host B are not forwarded to elsewhere through eth1.
		This is this way for security reasons. For example, eth0 connected to private network and eth1 to a public network
		-> the value in /file/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is set to 0
		echo 1>/file/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  # the pins go through
		etc/sysctl.conf
			net.ipv4.ip_forforwardforward = 1

On host01, if we have an entry for app01 in /etc/hosts file like 172.168.238.12 app01 and the DNS server which is used by host01 has 172.168.239.10 as app01's IP then which IP host01 will pick for app01 as per priority.
