continuous integration and continuous deployment/delivery (CI/CD) is a way to take code, package it up, and deploy it to a system
	CI process
		taking the code
		packaging it up
		giving it to the CD process
	CD process
		deploy the code to some system
		continuous delivery: There's some magical button that you have to press to deploy the code
		continuous deployment: There's zero human intervention, everything is automatic
www.jenkins.io
	the full CI/CD suite, all of the plugins, the ability to deploy it, the ability to host it yourself, it is all 100% free
	there are a ton of plugins
	install: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
		(centos)

		sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk -y
		sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo --no-check-certificate
		sudo rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
		sudo yum install jenkins -y
		
		modifying JENKINS_PORT environment variable in /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service file
			sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
				Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"

			systemctl status jenkins
			systemctl start jenkins
			systemctl restart jenkins

		backup
			do file system snapshots, snapshots aren't real backups
			or use plug-ins for backups
				Manage Jenkins -> Manage plugins-> Available -> ThinBackup -> Install without restart
					Manage Jenkins
			or write a shell script that backs up the Jenkins in sense
