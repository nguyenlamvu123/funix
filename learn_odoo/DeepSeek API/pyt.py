"""Okay, I need to write a step-by-step explanation for creating an Odoo module based on the user&apos;s description about Tender Management. Let me break this down.

First, the user provided a detailed structure of what they want in the module. They mentioned several fields like tender code, name, region, bidders, notes, content, application period, routes, and status. Also, there are deadlines and templates involved.

I should start by outlining the main features required. The module needs to manage tenders with various attributes, handle deadlines, allow bidders to participate, submit quotes, and evaluate bids. Additionally, there&apos;s a need for document management via templates.

Next, I&apos;ll think about how to structure this in Odoo. Since Odoo is modular, each feature can be handled by different models. The core of the system would likely be the Tender model, which includes all the mentioned fields. Then, a Bidder model to manage participants and their information.

Deadlines are important, so maybe creating separate models or using Odoo&apos;s cron features for scheduling could help. Each deadline like sending invitations or announcing results can be set with specific dates and triggers.

For the process steps, it makes sense to create a workflow that guides users through each stage. The user probably wants automated emails when certain actions occur, like reminders before deadlines or notifications of tender results.

Document management is another key part. Allowing users to attach or select templates from a library will streamline the document submission and approval processes.

I also need to consider security aspects, ensuring that sensitive data related to tenders is handled properly. Access controls for different roles will be necessary.

Now, considering existing Odoo features, I can use the Project model for bid evaluation but might need to customize it if it doesn&apos;t fit perfectly. The cron system in Odoo can manage deadlines and recurring tasks.

Potential challenges include ensuring that all features are integrated seamlessly and that the module is scalable for future needs. Testing each part thoroughly will be important to avoid bugs or performance issues.

Finally, I&apos;ll summarize the approach by listing the key components: models, workflows, document management, user interfaces, and security. This should provide a clear path for developing the module.
&lt;/think&gt;

Creating an **Odoo Module** based on the described &quot;Tender Management&quot; system can be broken down into several steps. Below is a detailed explanation of how to structure the module, including its features, models, workflows, and user interfaces.

---

### 1. **Define the Scope and Features**
The module will manage tenders, bidders, and related processes. Key features include:
- **Tender Details**: Tender code, name, region, participating bidders, notes, content, application period, routes, and status.
- **Deadlines**: automation for sending invitations, submission of bids, evaluation deadlines, and result announcements.
- **Templates and Documents**: attachment functionality for accompanying documents.

---

### 2. **Create the Core Models**
The module will require several models to represent different entities:

#### a. **Tender Model**
```python
class Tender(models.Model):
    _name = &quot;tender.tender&quot;
    
    # Fields
    tender_code = fields.Char(required=True)
    name = fields.Text(required=True)
    region = fields.Many2One(&apos;res_region&apos;, string=&quot;Region&quot;, required=False)
    bidders = fields.Many2Many(&apos;bidding.bidder&apos;, string=&quot;Participating Bidders&quot;, required=True)
    notes = fields.Text()
    content = fields.Html()
    application_period = fields.Datetime()
    tender_routes = fields.Many2Many(&apos;tender.route&apos;)
    status = fields.Selection([
        (&apos;draft&apos;, &apos;Draft&apos;),
        (&apos;sent&apos;, &apos;Sent to Bidders&apos;),
        (&apos;open&apos;, &apos;Open for Submission&apos;),
        (&apos;closed&apos;, &apos;Closed&apos;),
    ], default=&apos;draft&apos;)

    # Methods
    def send_invitation(self):
        pass

    def bidders_confirm(self):
        pass
```

#### b. **Bidder Model**
```python
class Bidder(models.Model):
    _name = &quot;bidding.bidder&quot;
    
    name = fields.Char(required=True)
    contact_person = fields.Many2One(&apos;res_partner&apos;)
    email = fields.Email(required=True)
    phone = fields.Phone()
    address = fields.Text()
```

#### c. **TenderDeadline Model**
```python
class TenderDeadline(models.Model):
    _name = &quot;tender.deadline&quot;
    
    tender_id = fields.Many2One(&apos;tender.tender&apos;)
    deadline_date = fields.Datetime(required=True)
    description = fields.Text()
    action_type = fields.Selection([
        (&apos;invitation&apos;, &apos;Send Invitation&apos;),
        (&apos;bid_submission&apos;, &apos;Bid Submission Deadline&apos;),
        (&apos;evaluation&apos;, &apos;Evaluation Deadline&apos;),
        (&apos;result_announcement&apos;, &apos;Result Announcement&apos;),
    ], required=True)

    def send_reminder(self):
        pass
```

#### d. **TenderTemplate Model**
```python
class TenderTemplate(models.Model):
    _name = &quot;tender.template&quot;
    
    template_name = fields.Char(required=True)
    content = fields.Html()
    attached_documents = fields.Many2Many(&apos;document.document&apos;)
```

---

### 3. **Define Workflows and Automations**
The module will use Odoo&apos;s workflow engine to automate the tender process.

#### a. **Workflow for Tender Submission**
1. When a new tender is created, it moves to &quot;Draft&quot; state.
2. When the &quot;Send Invitation&quot; action is triggered (via deadline), it sends an email invitation to bidders and updates their status.
3. Bidders confirm participation, and the tender moves to &quot;Open for Submission.&quot;
4. After the application period closes, bidders submit their quotes.

#### b. **Bid Evaluation Workflow**
- After bid submission, evaluations are conducted automatically (if enabled).
- The evaluation results are stored in the tender record.
- The status is updated to reflect the outcome.

#### c. **Announcement Workflow**
- Once all evaluations are done, the tender is marked as &quot;Result Announced.&quot;
- Notifications are sent to bidders and stakeholders.

---

### 4. **User Interface**
The module will have a user-friendly interface for managing tenders:

#### a. **Tender List View**
This view displays all tenders with their status, region, and deadline. Users can filter by region or status.

#### b. **Tender Form**
This form includes fields for tender details, participating bidders, application period, and routes.

#### c. **Bidder Management**
A separate interface allows users to manage bidder information and view submitted quotes.

---

### 5. **Document Management**
The module will integrate with Odoo&apos;s document management system (e.g., `document.document` model) to allow users to attach templates and documents directly to tenders.

#### a. **Template Selection**
Users can select predefined templates for invitations, evaluation forms, etc.

#### b. **Document Attachments**
Each tender can have multiple attached documents, which are managed through the document library.

---

### 6. **Security and Access Control**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.
- Only authorized users can view or edit certain fields based on their role.

---

### 7. **Testing and Validation**
The module must undergo thorough testing to ensure all features work seamlessly, including:
- Automations for deadlines
-Bidder participation flow
-Bid evaluation process
-Document management integration

---

### 8. **Deployment**
Once developed and tested, the module can be deployed using Odoo&apos;s built-in update system or through a custom installation.

---

This approach ensures that the module is modular, scalable, and aligned with Odoo&apos;s architecture, while meeting the specific requirements of the tend(venv) <font color="#4E9A06"><b>zaibachkhoa@zaibachkhoa-System-Product-Name</b></font>:<font color="#3465A4"><b>/media/zaibachkhoa/code1/funix/learn_odoo/DeepSeek API</b></font>$
